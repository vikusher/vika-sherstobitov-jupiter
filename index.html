        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Viktoriia Sherstobitova, originally from Saint Petersburg, Russia. I hold a Master's degree in
            Quality Control Management from Baltic State Technical University. I moved to the United States
            ten years
            ago and pursued new opportunities in the field of QA Automation. I earned two professional certificates in
            <a href="https://coursera.org/share/44e4eeec401bbe43603092d555ceffce" target="_blank"> Programming
                Foundations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS </a> and <a
                href="https://coursera.org/share/2f335f0c502c12df0780916f5d7d9407" target="_blank">
                Data Science Math Skills </a> from Duke University through Coursera. Additionally,
            I completed an SDET Bootcamp, which helped me transition from my previous experience in Quality Control in
            Russia to a career
            in QA Automation in the U.S. I worked as a QA Automation Engineer for 11 months, gaining hands-on experience
            with test automation
            frameworks, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Gherkin. I am passionate about learning new technologies and
            contributing
            to efficient and high-quality software solutions.
